Matches reimbursements from expensify to bank statements.

Bit particular and hardcoded to my particular setup.

Expects
* transactions.csv
* reimbursements.csv

Outputs the whole venn diagram. Matches that were found between the two, transactions without reimbursements, and reimbursements without transactions.


Thanks @walkerdb for the inspiration and the starting script!
